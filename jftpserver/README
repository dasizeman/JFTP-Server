JFTPServer
Dave Sizer
A simple FTP server in Java

I got rid of the scripts, and now use Maven for building :D

To build:
$ mvn clean package

From the project root (jftpserver/)

This will put a jar in the target/ directory

You can either move this JAR, or leave it where it is.

NOTE!! The server needs a credential file, 'creds.json', in the default working directory
This directory is the directory that you ran the java -jar command from.  This file is included
in the project root, and you can add your own credentials to it, but if you run the jar file from 
somewhere else, you will need to move this credential file there.  Anonymous access is also enabled.

The credential file format is as follows:

{
"dave":"magic",
"josh":"frogs"
}


NOTE!! The server will serve files from this same directory (the one you ran java -jar from)

You can then run the server with:
$ java -jar <jarfile> -log <log file name> -port <port to run server on>

All arguments are required

NOTE that the ubuntu default 'ftp' utility works really well for testing, but doesn't seem to be on tux
