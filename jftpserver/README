jftpd
Dave Sizer
A simple FTP server in Java

I now use Maven for building :D
$ sudo apt-get install maven

To build:
$ mvn clean package

From the project root (jftpserver/)

This will put a jar in the target/ directory

You can either move this JAR, or leave it where it is.

NOTE!! The server expects a configuration file, jftpd.conf, in the same directory that
the JVM is started from.  A sample jftpd.conf is provided in the project root as an example,
which contains details on what can be configured.

You can then run the server with:
$ java -jar <jarfile> -port <port to run server on>

All arguments are required

NOTE that the ubuntu default 'ftp' utility works really well for testing, but doesn't seem to be on tux

If the server just quits or you have any problems connecting, check the log
(configurable through the config file).

Common reasons for failure include:
- jftpd.conf is not in the directory you started the server from
- the server is unable to bind to the given port
- creds.conf is not in the directory you started the server from
