JFTPServer
Dave Sizer
A simple FTP server in Java

I now use Maven for building :D
$ sudo apt-get install maven

To build:
$ mvn clean package

From the project root (jftpserver/)

This will put a jar in the target/ directory

You can either move this JAR, or leave it where it is.

NOTE!! The server expects a configuration file, jftpd.conf, in the same directory that
the JVM is started from.  A sample jftpd.conf is provided in the project root as an example,
which contains details on what can be configured.

NOTE!! The server currently serves from wherever the JVM is started

You can then run the server with:
$ java -jar <jarfile> -log <log file name> -port <port to run server on>

All arguments are required

NOTE that the ubuntu default 'ftp' utility works really well for testing, but doesn't seem to be on tux
